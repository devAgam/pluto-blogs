# Who are we?

Since we are new to community as a platform, we suspect a little skepticism from the community towards us and our team, plutorepo is made by people who have been in the Jailbreaking community for a long period of time, we know and understand the community and the people who consist the community.

## Why choose us over other repositories

### Communication

Over the years we have observed peculiar barriers between the repository owners/maintainers and the developers or the consumers, where to take up common issues that need to be addressed immediately usually need to pass through multiple people and then if the owner's prudence is to be accounted for the owner might or might not reply to altercation.

We break the norms by openly keeping our DMs open for suggestions, feedbacks, and requests, wanna say hi feel free to shoot us a DM we will be more than happy to converse with you all since you are our family. We believe open DMs and frequent exchanges allow for a better relation and trust from your side.

### Creativity

We always look for creative new ideas to keep ahead of the competition though we are short handed and only a handful of us understand programming but we are still thrilled to take on new challenges, believe you have a cool idea shoot us a dm or email it to us plutorepo@gmail.com we will be honoured to work on your ideas.

Features that have been implemented by the suggestion of the community members:

<ul>
  <li>Save user preferences (Beta)</li>
</ul>

### Payout flexibility

In these trying times we came across developers who were suffering from unemployment and some in health crisis, and even in the dire situation of developers in question many repositories refused to release the developer's payouts. So, seeing this as an issue we have the provision where the administrator on duty will have the discretionary power to release your payouts on your request based on your situation.

We at the time of writing support these payout methods:

<ul>
  <li>Bank Transfers</li>
  <li>Xoom by PayPal</li>
  <li>PayPal Wallet</li>
  <li>Western Union</li>
</ul>
We are in talk with developers who don't yet have these services in their country of origin to possibly
support non conventional transfer systems like crypto currencies or services like wise.com

### Security

No system is perfect. So, we have one of our team members solely dedicated to find loop holes and security issues in our system, so far we have successfully disabled common piracy tools like Cydown and we are currently working on a offline key based system to keep the extensive crack groups at bay.

We at plutorepo aim to provide developers the best experience possible. incase you have any queries or suggestions feel free to contact us at plutorepo@gmail.com or on twitter @plutorepo
