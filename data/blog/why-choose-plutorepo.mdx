# Who are we?

Since we are new to community as a platform, we predict a little skepticism from the community towards us and our team, plutorepo is made by people who have been in the Jailbreaking community for a long enough period of time, to know and understand the community, to understand the people and the sentiments of those who consist of the community

## Why choose us over other repositories

### Communication

Over the years we have observed peculiar barriers between the repository owners/maintainers and the developers or the consumers, where to take up common issues that might to be addressed immediately one is needed to pass through multiple people and then if the owner's prudence and/or personal grudges are to be accounted for, the owner might or might not reply to the altercation.

We break the norms by keeping our DMs as owners and developers open for suggestions, feedbacks, and requests, wanna say hi feel free to shoot us a DM we will be more than happy to converse with you all since you are like our family. We believe open DMs and frequent exchanges allow for better and strong relations and trust.

### Creativity

We always look for creative new ideas to keep ahead of the competition though we are short handed at the moment and only a handful of us understand programming but we are always thrilled to take on new challenges, believe you have a cool idea shoot us a dm @plutorepo on twitter or email it to us at plutorepo@gmail.com we will be honoured to work on your ideas.

Features that have been implemented by the suggestion of the community members:

<ul>
  <li>Save user preferences (Beta)</li>
</ul>

### Payout flexibility

In these trying times we came across developers who were suffering from unemployment and some in health crisis, and even in the dire situation of developers in question many repositories refused to release the developer's payouts. So, seeing this as an issue we have the provision where the administrator on duty will have the discretionary power to release your payouts on your request based on your situation and in case of refunds on the payed out sales we will cover the refunds from our reserves and settle it later on through your future payouts.

We at the time of writing support these payout methods:

<ul>
  <li>Bank Transfers</li>
  <li>Xoom by PayPal</li>
  <li>PayPal Wallet</li>
  <li>Western Union</li>
</ul>
We are in talk with developers who don't yet have these services in their country of origin to possibly
support non conventional transfer systems like crypto currencies or services like wise.com

### Security

No system is perfect. So, we have a department solely dedicated to find loop holes and security issues in our system, so far we have successfully disabled common piracy tools like Cydown and bots using rate limiters and request normalization and we are currently working on an offline key based system to keep the extensive crack groups at bay i.e make http activation call responses be dependent on local client data to make a system not dependent on simple truthy and falsy flows (Currently available to a beta group).

### Not limited to iOS

It has been our aim to be a DRM and Distribution company from the get go, to make that possible we support monetization of softwares written for other platforms like windows, linux, android, and macOS. As of now we don't have these options enabled in developer dashboards but it can be enabled on request.

We at plutorepo aim to provide developers the best possible experience. incase you have any queries or suggestions feel free to contact us at plutorepo@gmail.com or on twitter @plutorepo
