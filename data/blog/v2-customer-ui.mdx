# New customer frontend

_Title_: v2 Customer UI

_Author_: Agamjot Singh Jashan

_Subject_: update

_Language_: English

## Introduction

Initially when we started working on plutorepo it was based on php and symphony, running with a team of 4. Everything was going well before we had
a difference of opinion causing many from the team to fall out. leaving only a handful, from the handful devAgam was the only one capable of working
on frontend and backend but we could not use any of the older code cause devAgam didn't know php, we shifted to react. We started by creating the first
version in create-react-app better known as CRA but over the months we realized that CRA wasn't going to cut it because of the performance issues, SEO issues, and reliability with different browsers and not to mention the minor bugs caused by the fault tolerant nature of Javascript.
