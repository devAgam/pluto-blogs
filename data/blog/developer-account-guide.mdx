# How to use your developer account

Welcome to [plutorepo.com](https://plutorepo.com), so to use your plutorepo developer account you need to head to [developer.plutorepo.com](https://developer.plutorepo.com).<br/><br/>

### Signing in

You will be greeted by a sign in screen as to maintain your security we use a stricter auth process for developer panel.
![GitHub Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/plutorepo-com/image/upload/v1628827282/sign-in-developer-page.png)
Here you should sign in with the same account that you got the developer access approved for.

## Tabs

Moving forward you should see this page ![GitHub Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/plutorepo-com/image/upload/v1628827559/general-over-view-dev-panel.png)
Here you would be able to see unique views for your package since the past 14 days

### Sales Analytics

In this tab you can see all your sales, refunds, and rejected transactions for the past 24 hours.
![GitHub Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/plutorepo-com/image/upload/v1628827766/sale-analytics-devs.png)
The reason to include these details is to allow for transparency and possibly studying patterns and fraudulent anomalies.

### Packages

Over here you can see your submissions and control the packages.
![GitHub Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/plutorepo-com/image/upload/v1628829334/package-info-dev-panel_j3mf9r.png)
Description and controls:

<ul>
  <li>Name: your package name.</li>
  <li>Type: type of your package.</li>
  <li>
    Status: current status of your package, (pending -> approved -> update pending -> update
    rejected | rejected).

![GitHub Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/plutorepo-com/image/upload/v1628829741/api-tab-dev-panel_ieiwvj.png)
Actions and controls:

<ul>
  <li>Generate New Key: Generate new api access keys.</li>
  <li>
    Test (checkbox): Sets your API key to test mode, implying your key would work only from one ip
    address (can be modified) and will only give a particular type of response, positive or negative
    (set by you).
  </li>
</ul>

#### Keys

![GitHub Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/plutorepo-com/image/upload/v1628830089/Key-depictions-dev-panel.png)

Here you can see that the 1st key is a test key you can modify its access, status, and response aspects.

The second key is a production key it can be accessed from everywhere i.e client side and can be disabled/enabled in case you want to disable previous versions of your package, while its not advised to use different keys for different package versions it is an option.

### User preferences persistence

In this tab you can create your package preference schema, sort of like MongoDB Schemas.

![GitHub Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/plutorepo-com/image/upload/v1628831798/Package-schema-page_baxcj6.png)

You have 3 main data types:

{' '}

<ul>
  <li>String</li>
  <li>Number</li>
  <li>Boolean</li>
</ul>
We also visualize the json structure to provide you with a better understanding.

More comprehensive explanation for the api and its usage is available in the 'Pref docs' tab.

Here you can read the documentation about the purchases verification api.
